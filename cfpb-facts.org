* Attacks

** Legislative

+ Passed House 2017-06-08 on party line vote
+ Gives president power to fire directors of Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and CFPB

+ Replaces CFPB director with bipartisan, 5-member commission

*** House vote to Overturn Mandatory Binding Arbitration Protection

+ Companies build a clause called /Mandatory Binding Arbitration/ into contracts
  + MBA blocks consumers from suing in disputes
  + This also blocks class action lawsuits
  + Disputes can only be settled through arbitration, with arbitrator chosen by company
+ CFPB created new rule banning MBA
  + Consumers regain right to class action suits
  + MBA becomes unenforceable
  + Affects financial services firms
  + Companies must review their existing practices to ensure compliance
+ House passed bill overturning rule
  + Could pass Senate any day
  + Would reinstate MBA clauses

** Executive

+ CFPB funded by Federal Reserve, not taxpayers
+ Seems to assume CHOICE will succeed
